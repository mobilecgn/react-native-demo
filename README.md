# react-native demo app for the talk flutter vs react-native

For an introduction to react-native, see the react-native
[Website](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) or
[Getting started documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started).

We use [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) for screen navigation (routing and transitions).

## Project setup

This project was setup with this commands:

```
react-native init Demo --template typescript
cd Demo
node setup.js # Add the typescript dependencies

yarn add react-navigation react-native-screens react-native-gesture-handler
```
